# Mentorship Program Builder Example

This project demonstrates the use of the Builder Pattern in C# to construct a Mentorship Program, linking students to mentors.

# Overview

The Mentorship Program is represented as a complex object that includes:

- Program name
- Start and end dates
- Lists of students and mentors
- Mapping of students to their respective mentors
  
# Components
- MentorshipProgram: Represents the main object being constructed.
- IMentorshipProgramBuilder: Defines the builder interface with methods to construct the program.
- MentorshipProgramBuilder: Implements the builder interface to build the MentorshipProgram.
- MentorshipProgramDirector: Manages the construction process using a builder instance.

# Benefits of the Builder Pattern
- Modularity: Components of the MentorshipProgram are built step by step, ensuring clear separation of concerns.
- Flexibility: Easily add new students, mentors, or modify existing pairs without changing the overall construction process.
- Scalability: Handles complex configurations of mentorship programs while maintaining readability and maintainability.
  
# Conclusion
The Builder Pattern is a powerful design pattern for constructing complex objects in a structured manner.This example demonstrates its application in building a Mentorship Program in C#, providing flexibility and scalability to manage mentor-student relationships effectively.
